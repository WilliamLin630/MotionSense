The goal of this project is to analyze the MotionSense dataset, which contains motion sensor data collected from smartphones while participants performed various physical activities. The primary questions we aim to answer are:

How can motion sensor data be used to classify different physical activities?
What are the patterns and characteristics of the data that can help in classification?
Could we "Fingerprint" users from their movement patterns?
Answering these questions is important because it can enhance activity recognition systems, which have applications in health monitoring, sports analytics, and other domains where understanding physical activity is crucial.
